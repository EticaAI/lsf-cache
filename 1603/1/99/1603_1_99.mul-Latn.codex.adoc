Rēs linguālibus::
  Lingua Anglica (Abecedarium Latinum):::
    _**Cōdex [1603:1:99]**_ is the book format of the machine-readable dictionaries _**[1603:1:99] Nōtitiae temporāriōrum circā librārium**_, which are distributed for implementers on external applications. This book is intended as an advanced resource for other lexicographers and terminology translators, including detect and report inconsistencies. It can, however, be used as an ad hoc dictionary if there is not derived work focused on your specific needs.
    +++<br><br>+++
    **ABOUT LEXICOGRAPHY**
    +++<br><br>+++
    Practical lexicography is the art or craft of compiling, writing and editing dictionaries. The basics are not far different than a millennia ago: it is still a very humane, creative work. It is necessary to be humble: most of the translator's mistakes are, in fact, not the translator's fault, but methodological flaws. Making sure of a source idea of what a concept represents, even if it means rewrite and make simpler, annex pictures, show examples, do whatever to make it be understood, makes even non-professional translators that care about their own language deliver better results than any alternative. In other words: even the so-called industry best practices of paying professional translators and reviewers cannot overcome already poorly explained source terms.
    +++<br><br>+++
    **ABOUT TYPES OF DICTIONARIES WE'RE COMPILING**
    +++<br><br>+++
    We're concerned with a group of ideas (we call it a group of dictionaries of concepts) which can be broken into smaller parts, reviewed for inconsistencies, improved for definitions, and then be translated by volunteers. Interlingual codes, such as what could be used on actual data exchange, are also added to each concept. Both glossaries, user interfaces (such as labels on data collection) and in some cases even standard codes for what would go on a data field could be compiled this way.
    +++<br><br>+++
    Since the full list of prototypal-dictionaries and dictionaries is huge, one way cited by objective audiences is the following:
    +++<br><br>+++
    . Humanitarian aid
    . Development aid
    . Human rights
    . Military relief (or conflict and conflict-resolution related concepts)
    +++<br><br>+++
    The itens 1, 2 and 4 https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian-Development_Nexus[are sometimes referred as _nexus_] and are often found helping _humanitarian crisis_. Since most contributors whose ideas and valid criticism are volunteers, then 3 (human rights, as in International Amnesty) to differentiate from humanitarianism (such as Red Cross Movement is reference).
    +++<br><br>+++
    Note that **dictionaries are not usage guides**. Instructions, when they exist, are mostly dedicated to lexicographers and translators.
    +++<br><br>+++
    **/PRO BONŌ PUBLICŌ/@lat-Latn**
    +++<br><br>+++
    The lexicographers of this work are both volunteers, doing it for free, pro bonō publicō, and don't accept donations for the sake of everyone's reusable dictionaries. Existing previous work often is based on old public domain books. Most terminology translators already would be volunteers because they believe in a cause. The best way to inspire collaboration is to be examples ourselves.
    +++<br><br>+++
    There's a non-moralistic aspect, fairly simple to understand: how expensive would it be to pay for everyone's work considering it is feasible over 200 languages? The logistics to decide who should be paid, then worldwide cash transfer (may include people from embargoed countries), then traditional auditing mechanisms to check misuse donors expect, exist? In special terminology (dictionary terms themselves) and so many languages, neither sufficient money nor humans interested in being coordinators exist.

== Archīa

Rēs linguālibus::
  Lingua Anglica (Abecedarium Latinum):::
    **Context information**: ignoring for a moment the fact of having several translations (and optimized to receive contributions on a regular basis, not _just_ an static work), then the actual groundbreaking difference on the workflow used to generate every dictionaries on Cōdex such as this one are the following fact: **we provide machine readable formats even when the equivalents on _international languages_, such as English, don't have for areas such as humanitarian aid, development aid and human rights**. The closest to such multilingualism (outside Wikimedia) are European Union SEMICeu (up to 24 languages), but even then have issues while sharing translations on all languages. United Nations translations (up to 6 languages, rarely more) are not available by humanitarian agencies to help with terminology translations.
    +++<br><br>+++
    **Practical implication**: the text documents on _Archīa prō cōdice_ (literal English translation: _File for book_) are alternatives to this book format which are heavily automated using only the data format. However, the machine-readable formats on _Archīa prō dictiōnāriīs_ (literal English translation: _Files for dictionaries_) are the focus and recommended for derived works and intended for mitigating additional human errors. We can even create new formats by request! The goal here is both to allow terminology translators and production usage where it makes an impact.

    ////\n**BUT ARE SPECIALIZED DICTIONARIES NECESSARY AT ALL?**
    +++<br><br>+++
    This preface text is generated with every Cōdex version, so this may be a prototype/draft one (which means not a good example), but the answer is: yes. But a _very boring yes_. References about decision making on dictionaries are very scarce through centuries, but a quick summary on this topic: **any dictionary compilation to be useful should be based on _de facto_ users needs, which is different from typical validation**.
    +++<br><br>+++
    Our dictionaries are strongly focused on multilingualism but as 2022, maybe the close discussion at international level would be https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Localisation_(humanitarian_practice)[Localisation (humanitarian practice)]. However, _localisation_ on these discussions is a different sense than https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization[Internationalization and localization], which is more aligned with use of these works on software.\n////\n**/PRO BONŌ PUBLICŌ/@lat-Latn**
    +++<br><br>+++
    The lexicographers of this work not only are volunteers doing it for free but they don't accept donations for the sake of everyone's reusable dictionaries. Existing previous work often is based on old public domain books and most terminology translators already would be volunteers because they believe in a cause. The best way to inspire collaboration is to be examples ourselves.
    +++<br><br>+++
    There's a non-moralistic aspect, fairly simple to understand: how expensive would it be to pay for everyone's work considering it is feasible over 200 languages? The logistics to decide who should be paid, then **worldwide** cash transfer (may include people from embargoed countries), then traditional auditing mechanisms to check misuse donors expect, exist? In special terminology (dictionary terms themselves) and so many languages, neither money nor humans interested in being coordinators exist.
    +++<br><br>+++
    Resuming: don't worth the trouble to be paid for this on such scale languages.</span>+++

=== /[HELP WANTED] Generated PDF don't have right fonts for all languages/@eng-Latn

Rēs linguālibus::
  Lingua Anglica (Abecedarium Latinum):::
    First, sorry if this affects your loved language. We're working on this, but we are still not perfected.
    If you have fonts installed on your computer, you very likely can still copy and paste from the eBook version.
    Please note that all formats intended for machine processing will work fine.


=== /[Book with Wikidata Q] I want to help! Some translation is missing or is wrong! How to change it?/@eng-Latn

Rēs linguālibus::
  Lingua Anglica (Abecedarium Latinum):::
    Most (but not all) concepts are using Wikidata Q. In fact, most of the time we improve Wikidata while preparing the dictionaries. Please check if the exact concept you want have a Q ID then click. There you can add translations.
    The next release (likely weekly) will have your submissions without need to contact us directly.


=== /[Book with Wikidata Q] I can find the Wikidata concept, but I'm unable to edit!/@eng-Latn

Rēs linguālibus::
  Lingua Anglica (Abecedarium Latinum):::
    While Wikidata is more flexible than Wikipedia's (for example, it allows concepts without need to create Wikipedia pages) even Wikidata can have concepts which require creating an account and don't allow anonymous editing. Creating such an account and confirming email is faster than asking someone else's do it for you.
    However, while vandalism on Wikidata is rare, very few concepts will require an account with more contributions and not created very recently. If this is your case, help with the ones you can do alone and the rest ask someone else to add to you.


=== /I heard there is an interest in having Cōdex beyond Latin language! How to do it?!/@eng-Latn

Rēs linguālibus::
  Lingua Anglica (Abecedarium Latinum):::
    Please contact us. This book uses Latin (sometimes _dog Latin_) to document all other languages, but we obviously can automated generation of books for others using other writing systems and some reference language. We need special help with writing systems such as Bengali, Devanagari and Tamil. For Right to Left scripts, despite being able to render the text, the book printing will require a different template. Only replacing Latin will not work, so we're open to ideas to make a great user experience!
