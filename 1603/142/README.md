> - _"Gunpowder was invented in China sometime during the first millennium AD. (...) The earliest possible reference to gunpowder appeared in **142 AD** during the Eastern Han dynasty when the alchemist Wei Boyang, also known as the "father of alchemy", wrote about a substance with gunpowder-like properties. (...) While **it was almost certainly not their intention** to create a weapon of war, Taoist alchemists continued to play a major role in gunpowder development due to their experiments with sulfur and saltpeter involved in searching for eternal life and ways to transmute one material into another"_ -- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_gunpowder
> - _"The earliest surviving chemical formula of gunpowder dates to 1044[18] in the form of the military manual Wujing Zongyao, also known in English as the Complete Essentials for the Military Classics, which contains a collection of factoids on Chinese weaponry.[19][20] However the 1044 edition has since been lost and the only currently extant copy is dated to 1510 during the Ming dynasty.[21] "_ -- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_gunpowder
