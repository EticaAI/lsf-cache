## '87'?

  - > _"Based on experiences with the Xerox Character Code Standard (XCCS) since 1980,[13] the origins of Unicode **date to 1987**, when Joe Becker from Xerox with Lee Collins and Mark Davis from Apple started investigating the practicalities of creating a universal character set.[14] With additional input from Peter Fenwick and Dave Opstad,[13] Joe Becker published a draft proposal for an "international/multilingual text character encoding system in August 1988, tentatively called Unicode". He explained that "[t]he name 'Unicode' is intended to suggest a unique, unified, universal encoding".[13]"_

## TODOs
While not really a priority, if eventually necessary, we can pre-compile the planes to use as part of other operations. **IPA in special may need this**
