Unless you have minimal training (just need dictionaries) or use such content on derived reviewed works which add more explanations, you're likely to make mistakes. It is still likely better than to not help at all, but take the opportunity to educate yourself.\n\n**Some common pitfalls**:\n\n. Your perceived sex or gender will affect whilling to someone else's admit a need which would be a taboo. Girls and women are likely to prefer to talk with someone perceived as gender female.\n. Someone which faced sexual abuse very likely would need to talk in privacy to a point of avoid ask help at all. Undesired pregnancy and, which is not biological sex specific, sexual transmissible diseases, need further attention as soon as possible. Be aware that people in distress are more likely to be abused and feel ashamed.\n. Multilingual dictionaries cannot be used as medical advice. Knowing translations of something such as paracetamol and the fact we grouped it under analgesic is still insufficient. Even such extra hints would take too much translations we can't scale up.\n. In case of people who are _on the run_ (without too much spare space on backpacks) one strategy if you have spare items is just leave at least the most basic items on some table and allow people to do some self-servicing. Ready-to-use kits are okay, but it is common people need individual selection when they have to consider extra height. It's still relevant to have humans for additional needs, but this at least helps typical issues with _taboo_ topics."
