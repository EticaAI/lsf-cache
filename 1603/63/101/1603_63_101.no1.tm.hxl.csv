With exception of _fist aid kit_ [[101]], all other categories evolved to be more generic, so even basic use requires you already know what you want in some language or use together with external guides focused on your intention.\n\n**1-99: INTRODUCTORY RELATED CONCEPTS**\nThe sections 1 to 99 contain mostly abstract ideas (such as what could be asked to someone else) which potentially could allow better options to give. Both for immediate reasons (such as known translations of ""pain"" and ""diarrhea"") or simply to do small scale data collection on your own language to decide food preparation, they _may_ be relevant. They're less vague on signals such as discover type of food ([[5]] list types of human diet) and at least most generic terms for non-specific intolerance and allergies ([[4]] Relevant conditions related to food or medicine. However, in special the dictionaries related to medical symptoms, they're obviously incomplete and mostly contain some terms related which could affect decision making on food, water and shelter.\n\n**101 AND BEYOND**\nAfter 101, the _de facto_ dictionaries of things which could be _give_ to aid other humans actually starts.\n\nRemember that this is a multilingual dictionary, not a user guide. The main goal of the dictionary with over 200 encyclopedic translations is both to help translators know what is missing in their language and to help with derived works."
