> - _"The origin of official **death investigation** is traced to at least **44 B.C**. with the Greek Physician Antistiusâ€™s examination of Julius Caesar (Fisher 1993; Gawande 2001)"_ -- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroner
>   - _"Julius Caesar, the Roman dictator, was assassinated by a group of senators on the Ides of March (15 March) of **44 BC** during a meeting of the Senate at the Curia of Pompey of the Theatre of Pompey in Rome. The senators stabbed Caesar 23 times. The senators claimed to be acting over fears that Caesar's unprecedented concentration of power during his dictatorship was undermining the Roman Republic, and presented the deed as an act of tyrannicide. (...) The ramifications of the assassination led to the Liberators' **civil war** and ultimately to the Principate period of the Roman Empire."_ -- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Julius_Caesar
