> - _"The origin of official **death investigation** is traced to at least **44 B.C**. with the Greek Physician Antistius’s examination of Julius Caesar (Fisher 1993; Gawande 2001)"_ -- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroner
>   - _"Julius Caesar, the Roman dictator, was assassinated by a group of senators on the Ides of March (15 March) of **44 BC** during a meeting of the Senate at the Curia of Pompey of the Theatre of Pompey in Rome. The senators stabbed Caesar 23 times. The senators claimed to be acting over fears that Caesar's unprecedented concentration of power during his dictatorship was undermining the Roman Republic, and presented the deed as an act of tyrannicide. (...) The ramifications of the assassination led to the Liberators' **civil war** and ultimately to the Principate period of the Roman Empire."_ -- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Julius_Caesar

## [1603:44:101] //Dictiōnāria basibus de Scielus contra humanus//
- //Dictiōnāria basibus de Scielus contra humanus//
  - Literal English Translation: Basic dictionaries about crimes against humans

> This group of dictionaries contains basic (id est, not fully detailed) concepts about crimes against humans at mostly at individual level and crimes against group of humans without intent of exterminate entire community (which have e dedicated dictionaries) for non political reasons.

## [1603:44:111] //Dictiōnāria basibus de Scielus contra communitae//
- //Dictiōnāria basibus de Scielus contra communitae//
  - Literal English Translation: Basic dictionaries about crimes against communities

> `+//Dictiōnāria basibus de scielus contra communitae//+` (literal English translation: _Basic dictionaries about crimes against communities_) contains basic (id est, not fully detailed) concepts about crimes against collectives of humans because of their membership (de facto or perceived) to be part of the collective. Another term for this is _Crimes against humanity_.

focus on concepts for things (not procedures, neither full guides) that can be given to other humans which either are in distress themselves or a helping others and language is a barrier for communication with you. While this could be used for people organizing a small camp from internally displaced people (issues with common dialect) or ad hoc refugee camp near a neighbor country border, espontaneos coordinators are likely to be more efficient with money [[1100]] or your offer your contact information and willing to do donation of services [[1200]] to help with logistics than in kind donations for items which are not immediately necessary.\n\nNearly all concepts have Wikidata Q Items, which if clicked (and you have internet) allow you to access Wikidata (and then Wikipedia). However, this book at least will have labels. (And yes, errors or missing translations to your loved language can be submitted to Wikidata!).\n\nSome items will have example images with credit for authors. The photos taken by the lexicographers specially for this work will not have external links (at least until we upload to Wikicommons on higher resolution) and we do this ourselves to make sure even annexes are also public domain.\n\n**INTRODUCTION SECTIONS**\nThe local codes from 1 to 9 actually do not have things to give to others, but concepts which likely would be very important in decision making of what is necessary.\n\n**NOT OPTIMIZED FOR MONOLINGUAL**\nThis group of dictionaries is unlikely to be useful for cases where everyone speaks the same language. You can explore por references or look for guides in your language to be more efficient.\n\nWhat this guide _could_ be useful is derived works where you intentionally automated some reference in your language (such as data collection of needs of other persons) and then the machine readable files of these dictionaries can be used to translate the terms to other languages. In practice it is not as trivial, both for lack of translations for every language and also because you may use resources only available in your region (something very common for types of foods).\n\n**OPEN TO SUGGESTIONS**\nWe're open to suggestions of groups of concepts to add and even creation of more dedicated dictionaries. However, dictionaries such as this one are not intended to be usage guides, which are harder to scale up translations and not trivial to make more internationalized approaches.
