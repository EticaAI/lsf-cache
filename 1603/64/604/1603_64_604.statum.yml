    mul-Zyyy: 'The decision making behind these dictionaries are general terminology
      related to water and improving human health through cleanliness.


      In English, in the humanitarian sector the typical term used is WaSH: Water,
      Sanitation and Hygiene. The Latin term we use is not a direct literal translation
      from the English term, but the idea behind the concept. Add to this that /sanitation/@lat-Latn
      is somewhat redundant with /hygiene/@fra-Latn, which would generate a nonsensical
      Latin term in this context.


      Another relevant topic which these dictionaries would contain terminology is
      the Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6 or Global Goal 6) about _clean water
      and sanitation for all_ (which is a concept much newer than the idea of WaSH
      on humanitarian sector). In English _hygiene_ is mentioned, but not as part
      of title or short descriptions.


      **How complete are these dictionaries?**

      The concepts here are incomplete and the current state is more focused on available
      translations we can compile. The ideal would be to prepare the definitions and
      start to add them on Wikipedia, which in turn would allow us to start having
      very well defined QIDs to scale translations.


      **Know issues**

      As 2022-04-19 the concept Q5893646 is an example of generating wrong translations.
      /Bucket toilet/@eng-Latn is linked to /Goldeimer/@deu-Latn (use of human excrementa
      exchanged for money). Ideally **before** asking for translation Initiatives
      we should review /Bucket toilet/@eng-Latn for a term easier to translate, not
      just create literal translations for other languages.'
