    mul-Zyyy: "The decision making behind the concept dictionaries was lingual terminology\
      \ translations and interlingual codes for organizations which often are mentioned\
      \ in humanitarian areas.\n\n**UN System**\n\nThe dictionary contains an incomplete\
      \ list of concepts of the UN System. \n\n**National Red Cross and Red Crescent\
      \ Societies**\n\nThe dictionaries contain National Red Cross and Red Crescent\
      \ concepts. It uses UN m49 as key, which can actually contain concepts that\
      \ do not have valid national organizations because they are not strictly a country.\
      \ The concepts which do are a country and have translations may also not be\
      \ at a given moment be acknowledged by the International Red Cross and Red Crescent.\n\
      \n**Subnational Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies**\n\nThe dictionaries here\
      \ do not list subnational organizations. However, we do have standardized suggestions\
      \ on how to decide a code for then: use the UN P-Code without the ISO 3166-1\
      \ letter prefix, but organize the subnational under the UN m49. Example:\n\n\
      . National Red Cross of Brazil\n.. Code: 63_76\n... Numerodinatio: 1603:45:1:63:76\n\
      . Subnational; Minas Gerais, Brazil\n.. UN P Code: BR33\n... Code: 63_76_33\n\
      ... Numerodinatio: 1603:45:1:63:76:33\n\nSome organizations which are not valid\
      \ national Red Cross and Red Crescent (because they are not strictly independent\
      \ counties) can encode them with this strategy.\n\n**Other humanitarian organizations\
      \ are missing**\nWe're still adding organizations which are neither UN or Red\
      \ Cross. However, we're likely to keep this focused on humanitarian aid and\
      \ have development aid. Human rights and humanitarian relief organizations will\
      \ not be added here"
