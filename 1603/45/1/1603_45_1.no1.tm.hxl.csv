The initial version was a mixed result of https://www.un.org/en/about-us/un-system and additional organizations which do exist on Wikidata/Wikipedia (including at Global level) with official websites on UN (see https://www.wikidata.org/w/index.php?search=United+Nations&search=United+Nations).\n\nAll work on the main concept tables is manually compiled and reviewed by EticaAI. The goal is to increase multilingualism. For the sake of disambiguation, names, abbreviations and definitions (when they're found) are used from official UN sources as 2022-01.\n\nAuthoritative status: this work is not authoritative. The main goal is to compile and share community translations and be good enough to be usable.\n\n**Caveats**:\n\n. The current version is incomplete. Neither the Wikimedia ecosystem nor the UN system (as admitted on their reference) are complete. A reviewed version of both can still be incomplete or have additional errors. Worst case scenario: label an single organization to wrong Wiki QID (lexicography compilation error). Typical scenario: some organization missing and you (aware of this) don't ping us to add it.\n. The community translations are not official. This doesn't mean they're necessarily wrong: with up to 200 potential language translations it would be hard for any organization to have human resources to validate."
