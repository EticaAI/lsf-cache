0_1603_1_7_2616_7535,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The decision making behind the concept dictionaries was lingual terminology translations and interlingual codes for organizations which often are mentioned in humanitarian areas.\n\n**UN System**\n\nThe dictionary contains an incomplete list of concepts of the UN System. \n\n**National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies**\n\nThe dictionaries contain National Red Cross and Red Crescent concepts. It uses UN m49 as key, which can actually contain concepts that do not have valid national organizations because they are not strictly a country. The concepts which do are a country and have translations may also not be at a given moment be acknowledged by the International Red Cross and Red Crescent.\n\n**Subnational Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies**\n\nThe dictionaries here do not list subnational organizations. However, we do have standardized suggestions on how to decide a code for then: use the UN P-Code without the ISO 3166-1 letter prefix, but organize the subnational under the UN m49. Example:\n\n. National Red Cross of Brazil\n.. Code: 63_76\n... Numerodinatio: 1603:45:1:63:76\n. Subnational; Minas Gerais, Brazil\n.. UN P Code: BR33\n... Code: 63_76_33\n... Numerodinatio: 1603:45:1:63:76:33\n\nSome organizations which are not valid national Red Cross and Red Crescent (because they are not strictly independent counties) can encode them with this strategy.\n\n**Other humanitarian organizations are missing**\nWe're still adding organizations which are neither UN or Red Cross. However, we're likely to keep this focused on humanitarian aid and have development aid. Human rights and humanitarian relief organizations will not be added here",
