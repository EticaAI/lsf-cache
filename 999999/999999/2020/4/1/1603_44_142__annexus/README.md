# 1603_44_142__annexus

The subdirectories contain attachments for the concepts of 1603_44_142 similar to how they are documented by different experts from different world regions. Each README.md file will contain at least these informations:

- License (using https://spdx.org/licenses/ identifier, when available)
- Full copyright notice
- Source of content, and date

All work on this folder at bare minimum allows it to be released as an annex to 1603_44_142 for scientific use. This means they can be used as reference for others know if we're talking about the same thing, which is essential to allow both for changes on the coding systems and or it's translations.

## Why content here is not also public domain

The 1603_44_142, beyond the fact already trying to organize terminology translations in a taxonomic way, deals with a scientific area _too recent_ to have public domain works.
A century ago, firearms were not as popular as they are today, so even new Latin terms would need to be introduced to fill this gap.
This also means that quite often regional authors use eponyms to mean the same concepts.

## Why eponyms are bad (both for translations and source of regional disagreement)

> **Use case**: _Nomina Anatomica (NA) was the international standard on human anatomical terminology from 1895 until it was replaced by Terminologia Anatomica in 1998. (...) Vernacular translations of Latin and Greek, as well as various **eponymous terms**, were barriers to effective international communication. There was disagreement and confusion among anatomists regarding anatomical terminology._ -- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomina_Anatomica

The 1603_44_142 have as intent both have numeric codes and make easier for authoritative translations, but eponyms are complicated to translate or remember, it's not just about the fact that some regions may disagree. Regional authors could still use synonym, and we may have to use pictures to allow each one know what others are talking about, but the ideal end result would be to have a more neutral terminology.
