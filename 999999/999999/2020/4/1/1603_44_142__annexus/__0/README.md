Close-range gunshot-wound in the Region of the Heart Produced with a Revolver of 9 mm. Caliber. Natural Size.

Two fingers' breadth inner side and n little above the left nipple there is a circular opening, 4 mm. in diameter — looking as though produced with a punch. It has blackened edges and a black base, and to the right of it there is a dried streak of blood. The perforation is situate in the middle of a likewise circular, dried, leather-like, brown- ish-black area, which latter in turn is surrounded by an irregularly round and indistinctly limited zone, about the size of a dollar. The latter is much excoriated and is beginning to become dried. The entire region was originally covered with powder-dust, after the removal of which a second discoloration persisted. This latter is especially marked in the ui)per half of the outer excoriated zone, and consists of numer- ous black points which cannot l)e washed away, and which have been produced by unexploded or but partially exploded grains of powder. Finally, one notices, after cleansing the wound of entrance and the adjoining parts, still a third — the most external— zone. It is the size of the palm of the hand and extends to the left, beyond the nipple. The skin over it is slightly proniinent; it is doughy to the touch and bluish in color.

Examining the individual details of this gunshot-injury more care- fully, one finds that the circular perforation was without doubt caused by the bullet; but as the opening measures only 4mm. in diameter, while the bullet measures 9 mm., the wound of entrance is much smaller than the projectile. This is only to be explained by assuming that the skin retracted after the occurrence of the perforation, occasioning a diminution in the size of the opening. When there does not occur a laceration of the wound, due to the direct force of the explosion — such as happens in shots from the immediate vicinity with large weapons — the bullet causes a funnel-shaped inversion or stretching of the skin. At the same instant it i)erforates the apex of the funnel, permitting retraction of the remainder of the stretched skin. By this procedure the inner surface of the cone-shaped inverted portion of the skin becomes abraded and forms, after the occurrence of the perforation, the inner leather-like dried zone, which one generally, though incorrectly, designates the "burnt margin." The circular form of its limitation corresponds with the extent of the skin which was inverted, and approximately, therefore, with the caliber of the bullet. Of the occur- rence of these phenomena one can satisfy himself by shooting through a tense plate of India-rubber.

**The edges of the "burnt margin" in close-range shots are usually undermined to a considerable extent, particularly when the weapon is held in close apposition to the body. In addition, the edges of the perforation are blackened with powder, this being an important characteristic of close-range shots. The undermining is due to the direct action of the explodino: gas, which penetrates between the skin and the firmer structures beneath (the wall of the thorax, the skull, etc.).**

The zone surrounding the "burnt margin" is the result of the contusions of the skin produced by the exploding gas, being possibly also due to singeing of the tissues. **The blackening on and in this area is caused by the powder, that which could be washed away being due to the powder-dust, that which is scattered and punctiform being due to inclusion within the skin of grains of powder.**

On the other hand, the external bluish area, the size of the palm of the hand and doughy to the touch, is due to the suffusion of blood which had collected in the subcutaneous and intermuscular tissue in the neighborhood of the wound.
